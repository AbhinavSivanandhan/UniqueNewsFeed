'''to do:
write better regex to split hashtag, using word based parsing(matching words) rather than depending on capital letters, to avoid the occasional odd error, | But works well, coz same regex on both sides
to detect tags lang, translate and add to document(lang support for more langs) 
avoid writing tags multiple times in document 
fix maxrequest exceeded error using proxy, and out of index errors | 
get better way to end program | non func req
profanity detection , can use corpus and cosine similarity again, or profanity library, under consideration
        profanityfilter
        profanity-check library  done
fix random outputs during every run error | Unidentified
track code, avoid using same variable for cosine similarity | Done
using maxent classifier model to train and do sentiment analysis
Try and catch langdetect exception
Always have a set of tags in newstagsdone.txt coz otherwise index error occurs, write something after truncating
Find intersection of location specific tweets
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2527892/parsing-a-tweet-to-extract-hashtags-into-an-array-in-python
Use it to write all hashtags found with tweet into newstagsdone.txt
precise location detection
improving regex 
Keep in mind the Index error which occurs is cosine similarity work on empty document
Use simple regex to extract words followed by hashtag in tweets, to collect all future topics to be rejected(or added to taglist)
Above error occurs when topics appear different by name, but are of same context(happens during ipl season when feed is filled with names of cricketers, thereby not giving the user a balanced feed)
This also needs to use spacy to find named entities and tag them accordingly
To find alternative APIs to support the twitter api, by providing personalised and varied content.
Find a solution to provide user with full tweet rather than the occasional half tweet given. Also, filtering all the noise and unwanted clauses to provide crisp content to the user.
Perfecting all the modules. Note that functioning still works despite inaccuracies due to certain 'allowances' for each module. Can be improved
Program should depend lesser on user's cognitive abilities and sufficiency outside the app(i.e, googling to find out other details about the topic).
